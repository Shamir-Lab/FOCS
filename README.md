# FOCS
Codebase for FOCS, a new method for inferring enhancer-promoter (E-P) links and for integrative analysis of E-P links

# Getting FOCS database
You can download the database [here](http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/focs/download.html).
The database includes preprocessed RData files of ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, FANTOM5, and GRO-seq:
1) Predicted E-P links
2) Genomic positions of enhancers and promoters
3) Enhancer/promoter count/RPKM profiles
4) Sample annotations

In addition the database includes external data for integrative analysis of E-P links:
1) ChIA-PET interactions mediated by POL2 of 4 cell types (MCF7, HCT-116, K562 and HelaS3) taken from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39495">GSE39495</a>
2) Genomic positions of GTEx eQTL data (V6 and V6p builds) taken from <a href="https://www.gtexportal.org/home/">GTEx Portal</a>
